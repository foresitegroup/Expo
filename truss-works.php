  <h4>Hyperlite: Tool-less hybrid truss</h4><br>
  Hyperlite is an ultimately reconfigurable system. As you increase your display size or change your design, you will typically be able to use all or most of your existing components. This makes Hyperlite an excellent display investment.<br>
  <br>
  When designing with Hyperlite, you not only create connecting spans between elements but you create panel opportunities. Through good planning, you can make the most of your budget and your display by an efficient and effective use of graphics, solid panels and maybe even slatwall!<br>

  <h4>Xpress&reg;Truss</h4><br>
  Do you like the look of a truss display but you don't like the weight, freight, and labor that comes with it?  Xpress Truss is for you!  Available in a 4" light-duty model and a medium-duty 8" model, this system assembles without tools.  Utilizing a high-impact plastic over aluminum construction, Xpress Truss is extremely lightweight and resists dents and scratches.  And, you won't see another truss system that stores and ships as compact: the 8" model even collapses!<br>
  <br>
  Various straight lengths and curved sections, in combination with joiners, connectors, bases, shelves, and counters will allow your imagination to run wild and unlimted configurations are possible.  RasterPrint&trade; graphics mount with a simple rod pocket and connectors that clip to the truss.<br>
  <br>
  Xpress Truss will change the way you think about truss!<br>
