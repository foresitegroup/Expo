Having worked with Mark and the Expo Milwaukee team for over 20 years as ExpoDisplays representatives we've found them to be top-notch in there approach to customer service, attention to detail, integrity and business acumen. The Expo Milwaukee team is a benchmark by which other display representatives can be measured &mdash; ExpoDisplays and I are proud to have had such a long running relationship with Mark and the team.<br>

We exhibit at dozens of trade events each year, and thanks to Expo Milwaukee we've finally found a cost-effective, easy-to-set up, and attractive unit for our booths.  Plus, its unique design really sets us apart from our neighbors. Mark does a great job shipping, storing and repairing our exhibits too &mdash; saving us a lot of time and from a lot of headaches!<br>

Two years ago I attended a trade show in Milwaukee and the best thing to come from that particular trade show was meeting Mark from Expo Milwaukee.  I  now think of Mark as an extension of my company.  Whenever I have a client who needs a trade show booth I immediately call Mark.  He is great to work with, very knowledgeable about his product line and overall good guy. If you need anything relating to your trade show needs I encourage you to call EXPO MILWAUKEE, you won't be disappointed!<br>

I want to thank you for all your help in design and layout of the banners and table throw we recently ordered.  Many people at of conference came by and complemented on how nice they all looked.  Many asked where I got them done at.  The table throw drew many people into our booth.  Most of them complimented on how professional the booth looked.  Some of the visitors to my booth had banners but were really impressed with how easy the Silver Step was to operate and loved the base that had no support legs.  You are the best and I am recommending your firm to anybody that is looking for the same results.<br>
