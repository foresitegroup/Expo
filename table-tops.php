  <h4>FS&trade; Table Top Display</h4><br>
  The Folding Stackables &mdash; more commonly known as "FS" &mdash; is the original folding display. And it's no accident that it's most popular form is the FS Table Top Display. Simply unzip the carry bag and unfold the unit and you are ready to start installing your Velcro&reg; compatible graphics. Extend the height and add a dramatic flare with an FS Header in a contrasting or coordinating color. Choose from the "FS Mini", our most popular model the "FS Classic 3P", or the larger "FS Classic 4P". All models are available with optional stacking headers, lighting, and rotomolded shipping cases. And be sure to check out RasterPrint Loop, our process for putting full-color photographic images directly on the Velcro-compatible fabric of the FS Table Top Display.<br>

  <h4>Table Covers</h4><br>
  No matter the size or configuration of your booth, there is always a table that needs to be covered, hidden, or coordinated with the rest of the exhibit. And, whatever your requirement, we have an option for your table. Table Covers are also functional as they create instant hidden storage under the table. Our wide range of imprint options can be used to add your logo or message. Whether you're looking to simply cover a table in a coordinated color fabric, or if you want the table to be the center of your booth... We've got you covered.<!-- <br>
